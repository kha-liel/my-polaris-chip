      This is <span style="color:navy"><b>Cloud Gate</b></span>, officially known as <span style="color:navy"><i>The Bean</i></span>, located at the AT&T Plaza in Millenium Park, downtown 
      Chicago. It was created by Anish Kapoor for a highly reflective, interactive, and monumental sculpture that engages with the city's skyline, sky, and lake. Its visual aspect, ispired by 
      liquid mercury, is to distort and blend the surrounding urban environment to make viewers a part of the artwork.

      and engineer Gustave Eiffel as a gift from France to celebrate American independence and the shared goal of liberty. Its visual aspects are full of meaning: the 
      <span style="color:darkgreen"><b>torch</b></span> lights the way to freedom, the <span style="color:darkgreen"><b>crown's spikes</b></span> represent the seven seas and 
      continents, and the <span style="color:darkgreen"><b>broken chains</b></span> at her feet signify the end of slavery and moving past unfair control.

      the famous <span style="color:chocolate"><b>International Orange</b></span> color was chosed to help the bridge stand out in thick fog and its 
      <span style="color:chocolate"><b>Art Deco</b></span> style, seen in the tail towers and straight lines, was meant to make it look like a modern work of art.

      futuristic and thin: the <span style="color:indigo"><b>top house</b></span> is shaped like a flying saucer to represent space travel, while its <span style="color:indigo"><b>wasp-waisted legs</b></span> 
      were inspired by an abstract sculpture of a dancer to give it a graceful and modern look.
